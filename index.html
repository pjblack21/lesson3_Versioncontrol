            <p class="lead"> 
In this topic I will discuss version control. This topic is important to me because it helps with the messy confusion of file sharing. In this class it is important because remaining organize is key to a great web design. Version control is basically one main repository for all project files. It allows for teammates to go in and edit files in a controlled manner. It allows them to edit their files simultaneously. It prevents others from modify your work without your permission. Their systems cannot be overwritten. It also allows you to revert back to your older versions. It even backs up your files so you don't have to start a project over.

            <p class="lead">This topic is important to me because it is the first version control system I have ever used. It will help me with my understanding of version control. It's important to the class because of its ability to work with multiple workflows and remain organized.  Git is a free source of version control that handle small and large projects with efficiency. There are many versions of git. It allows you to create local branching and is convenient for staging areas. Everyone that uses this version control system get a complete copy of the repository data and it is stored on the local machine. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commands are very important to me because it is the language the system uses. To truly understand this version control system understanding what these commands do is very important. Git commands are important for this class because it allows us to operate the system for proper webpage development. Git commands have lots of different meanings. Git add tells the system that this is my file and I want to add it to the staging area. Git commit command tells the system to now move the file and commit it to the local repository station. There are many other commands that are used to operate the system. That was just a few of them. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This topic is interesting to me because I've always wondered how things start. Understanding our history can better help us operate in our future. It's important to the class because it helps us understand where this commonly used system came from and why it was necessary. Back in the day a open source software project with a fairly large scope called Linux kernel began using a proprietary DVCS called bit keeper. Their relationship eventually breaks down and frees up Linux creator Linus Torvalds to develop his own tool. Based on the premise of bitkeeper, in 2005 Git is created. With this new system they wanted it to be faster with a more simple design. I believe they achieve their goal. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This topic is interesting to me because I have always found it a lot simpler to copy something then to rewrite the whole deal. It's important for this class because it's a part of learning to use the tool called Git. If you wanted to get a copy of an existing Git repository you use the command “git clone” . This is only part of the process because when this function is called the program received a full copy of nearly all data the server has. The command has to be followed by the url of the desired repository. This allows for the cloning to be exact without all the extra files.</p>
